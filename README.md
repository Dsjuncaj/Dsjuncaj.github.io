  ### CPSC 120
  
  * Lab 10: Lab 10 part 1 was a favorite because I had a great partner to work with. Not to mention the technicality of finding a prime number was super fun todo, felt like a real computer wizard.
    
  * Lab 1: The first lab was my favorite because it was the start of it all. No other lab would have been compleeted without knowing the basics on using Github. For that, I have to give it to Lab 1 for teaching me.

  * Lab 8: Lab 8 was a favorite becasue I was always a fan of Mad Libs as a kid. So it was very fun for me to learn how the proccess of making them works in code.
